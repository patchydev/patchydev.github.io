# About

My name is Isabelle, but I mostly go by Isa. I'm a trans girlthing who enjoys programming, speedcubing, reading, and playing chess. I'm also an avid Linux user. I like listening to trap music, my favorite artists are Ghostemane, Warlord Colossus, and Kill Dyll. Professionally, I'm a DevOps engineer in the agriculture tech field.
