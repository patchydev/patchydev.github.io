### Warning: bad, poorly documented code lies ahead

I like to do silly things with computers, here's some of my favorite:

## [Image Replacer Proxy](https://github.com/patchydev/network-file-replacer)
This is quite possibly the most cursed thing I've ever done on a computer. It acts as a proxy that replaces some percent of images to an image. It's funny. Made in Rust and Python. Good luck figuring out how to compile it lol

## [Theo](https://github.com/patchydev/theo)
A chess engine/library written in Rust... that doesn't fully work. Currently procrastinating a complete refactor.

## There's more...
I'm just either not proud of it, or am under a legally binding contract to not share them.
